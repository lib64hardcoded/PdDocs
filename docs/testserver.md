# Prodomo Test Client.

We appreciate receiving **feedback** and strive to **improve** continuously. To facilitate the evaluation of our server, we have created a special **test client** where you can spend your free time **testing** the Prodomo project.

Feedback is always welcome! If you encounter a **problem** or have a **suggestion**, you can leave it on our Discord server, which you can find in the navigation bar or by clicking [here][discord]. What are you waiting for? Do you want to start your own server? Try **Prodomo**!
