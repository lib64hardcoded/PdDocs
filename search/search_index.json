The second function is for costumes, which now holds all costumes, including auras and scarves. The third function is the safebox &amp; item shop, integrated directly into the special inventory.</p> <p>The third system added in version 5.3 is the Multi-Refine system. This system is designed to avoid disrupting the market or rendering the crafting system obsolete. The Multi-Refine system is intended to enhance the design and functionality of the classic refining system. Now, when evolving an item, you can direct it toward two different upgrades, whether PVM (Player vs. Monster) or PVP (Player vs. Player). The Multi-Refine system supports an unlimited number of upgrade choices, each with its own costs (refine_set or yang). This system is optional and does not affect the classic refining system, as it is based on a separate SQL table.</p> <p>The fourth system is the Chest Drop Info, which has been rewritten.</p> <p>Prodomo now also features new dungeons: Sung-Mahi, Alastor, and Queen Nethis, all included in the Yohara Expansion pack.</p> <p>Additionally, the systems added for the 64-bit version have been rewritten to ensure maximum functionality, and many systems and text files have been moved to .json or .xml formats.</p> <p>Version 5.3 is now available for purchase, so please contact us if you are interested in acquiring the PD-Files.</p>"},{"location":"changelog/","title":"Changelog","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#commit-changes-to-version-5","title":"Commit changes to version 5","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#1.0.3","title":"1.0.3 Febuary 20, 2025","text":""},{"location":"changelog/#added","title":"added","text":"<ul> <li>The Demon Tower dungeon has been completely restructured; it is now fully aligned with the official version.
